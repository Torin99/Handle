A twist on the popular New York Times Puzzle game 'Wordle', this variation uses the ASL alphabet as input to help you get a **Handle** of Sign Language

## About

Handle is a **Sign Language Detection** game created for submission to the W23 Project Program Competition. Created in React, It uses Google's open source machine learning API **MediaPipe Hands** to detect hand landmark placement and accurately predict sign letters from user input. With example hand gestures, it is a fun and interactive way to learn Sign Language.
