A twist on the popular New York Time's Puzzle game 'Wordle', this variation uses the ASL alphabet as input to help you get a **Handle** of Sign Language

## ⁉️ About

Handle is a **Sign Language Detection** game created for submission to the W23 Project Program Competition. Created in React, it uses Google's open source machine learning API **[MediaPipe Hands](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/hand_landmarker)** to detect hand landmark placement and accurately predict sign letters from user input. With example hand gestures, it is a fun and interactive way to learn Sign Language. 

Handle is submitted to Project Program for team **IBM & Chandler** with support from team members:
- Riley Adams
- Chandler Mayberry
